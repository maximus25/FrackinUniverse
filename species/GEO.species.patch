    "value" : "GEOs are biomechanical organisms, first assembled as skeletons and then grown in CCVs. A cybernetic headband is fused to their skull and directly connected to their complex brains, acting as their nonexistent sensory organs. The GEOs are physically hardy, have better fall damage tolerance, and can survive in extremely hot or high pressure enviorments; further more they can breathe underwater through subcutaneous respiration. However, the GEOs fair poorly with the cold, are quite flammable, and take extra damage from shadow based damage.
